Tips:
✓1 - There is a list of possible fields for each piece, and if the check from the moving king does not fall after all possible moves, then checkmate is issued
2 - after issuing a positive result by the check_mate function, a message with the winner is sent to both players, change all fields in the statuses of both players
3 - User_info fields: last_game_id, losses, wins, draws, name NOT NULL, id NOT NULL, tg_id, lang NOT NULL(Eng def), status
4 - Special mode where you can replays figures so as you want
5 - add a special database with move records and a special field with the current move
6 - start_game characteristics: Time for each player, ability to undo
7 - English, Dutch, Ukrainian, Russian
